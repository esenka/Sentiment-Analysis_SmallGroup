essay
I enjoyed the experience  it was completely new to me  Immersing myself in the world of virtual reality reminded me a bit of the old video games I used to play as a child  I consider it a positive experience that I would gladly do again  I didn t expect to perceive and be perceived in such a realistic way in this virtual environment  The first few minutes were a bit confusing  but the more time you spend inside  the more you get used to it and understand how it works  In fact  the more time you spend inside  the more you want to stay there  It could potentially create addiction  similar to video games or the topics we discussed during the conversation  such as social media  The discussion we had during this study was interesting because it felt much more similar to reality  creating a strong connection  I absolutely evaluate this experience positively  and if I have the opportunity in the future  I believe I will participate again 
The sensation of seeing others in virtual reality was weird because they looked like themselves in real life  they even had the same voice but my brain could still understand that this was not real  I enjoyed the experience a lot and I think I would like to use this kind of technology in the future but I think that the quality of the image still has to go through a process of improvement  Also  I was not really able to see things with focus because everything was blurred and when I put the VR off  my eyes took a bit before adjusting to reality again  Something that surprised me was that I had personal interaction with other participants and even if they were avatars  I felt somehow a fiscal/emotional connection with them  Of course in real life  this talk that we had would sound less formal  with more human interaction and different freedom of movement  In virtual life  I felt somehow less controlled and I was trying to explore my fake hands with unusual movements  That s something that in real life could look weird so I ll say that I felt freer than in real life 
 A stimulating experience  The objects had a nice design  and I really liked the avatars as they responded to all the required movements  I experienced some slight eye discomfort once I took off the headset  and I think there are a few things that could be improved  such as the audio (I couldn t hear Alessia and Nicola optimally) and some bugs with the arms  This experience made me reflect on the power that a virtual world can have when used as an information exchange  as in the experiment we carried out  I believe the differences between a virtual meeting and a real one lie in the fact that emotions are not expressed as effectively  and we don t notice changes in facial expressions (which I consider fundamental in a conversation) 
 Regarding the visual aspect  it was somewhat bothersome and not well-focused  and I ended up getting a headache over time  especially considering that I am sensitive to such things  In terms of the overall experience quality  I would say it was excellent  It was my first time  and the communication and interactions were smooth  Since I didn t know the other participants  it seemed easier to interact with fewer inhibitions  I had no difficulty expressing my opinion or engaging with others  Perhaps it would have been beneficial to include icebreaker questions or a minimal exchange of names with the other participants  In the future  I would like to use these technologies  but with improved visual quality  especially if prolonged use is required 
 It was a new and very strange experience  Obviously  without being able to read facial expressions and without true eye contact  it feels like talking to a robot that speaks very well and understands you perfectly  However  the connection to reality is completely or almost completely lost  The use of this technology scares me a bit because the energy of the other person is completely absent  and everything has to be managed through the way of speaking  volume of the voice  tone  and other factors  It feels exactly like a video game  so I m not sure if I can imagine it outside of this context  such as in work or educational settings  Personally  I don t agree that it could be used in the mentioned fields in the future  but this comment is purely based on the fact that at this moment  talking to conscious puppets unsettles me  I m not exactly sure how much time has passed  but it seemed shorter  maybe due to the conversation or perhaps due to the novelty  As a general comment  I much prefer face-to-face contact  I found it bothersome to have the clock on the left side when I usually wear it on the right 
 I greatly appreciated this kind of experiment as it brings us closer to the surrounding reality  Of course  as with anything  it is crucial not to abuse it  as excess can be dangerous  However  it seemed to me like an excellent method for interacting with other people  and for example  it can be very useful in educational settings and represent a new frontier in learning  enhancing the skills of each child  It was my first experience with virtual reality  but if I had the opportunity  I would use it again because it is capable of breaking through spatial and temporal boundaries in a disruptive way  I cannot compare this experience to a face-to-face conversation  perhaps due to my limited familiarity with these techniques  which consequently led me to focus on specific aspects of the tool  Nevertheless  I can affirm that in terms of sensations  it certainly comes very close to a face-to-face experience  which I could perceive from the very beginning  something I didn t think was possible  The experience is highly immersive 
 The experience was initially really exciting and felt unique  However  after 20 minutes  it started to feel a bit claustrophobic  Knowing that I couldn t get out of the chair I was sitting on and there was no other room to be in  it created a sense of confinement  The computers in the background didn t work  and in fact  nothing was real  While having mundane conversations with friends  the feeling that  nothing is real  everything is a construct  became amplified  and I felt dizzy and powerless  I did not like that feeling  especially when the room design resembled the series  SEVERENCE  haha  Perhaps if I were in a more open space  like a forest picnic or something similar  I would feel better  Nevertheless  I m glad to have been part of this experience 
 Overall  I am satisfied with this social experiment and being part of it  However  I believe that if it had lasted longer than half an hour  I might have struggled  Regarding the conversations we had in the virtual environment  I don t think it can replace face-to-face conversations  However  during the conversation  I felt that I was able to move away from my outward biases  and I found this aspect to be very interesting  I believe that creating such an environment would have an impact on people with social anxiety and help them express themselves better 
It was a fun experiment with friendly conversation on today s society problems and issues  The questions were clear and a lot to talk about  Virtual world made the conversations more interesting because even the questions are reliable with virtual world social media and digital world  So it was on point to discuss them  Nevertheless  there needs to be some improvements on the virtual effects and sound system  In my opinion being more relax and being able to easily move are really important while everyone were discussing  Also  the battery should be more longer  This technology in my opinion should be using in the work for meetings  Other than that  for a friendly reunion to discuss something or have some fun together while everyone is in other places  The atmosphere can be upgraded  For the kids and adults  the gaming part can be really good and exciting  To sum up  it was a satisfying experiment 
Regarding the quality of the experience  I really believe that the avatars could resemble more to us  and that the hand gestures and mimics could resemble more to us  Soundwie  everything was heard clearly and there was no disturbing background sounds  I had used VR before  and personally  I would want to use it for educational purposes  provided that the avatars can make me forget that I am in a simulation sometimes  This experience has been satisfying though  I felt as if I was talking having a discussion with the other participants in real life  given the quality and clarity of sound  Also  the discussion was about a topic that was highly interesting for me  I enjoyed it overall 
The overall experience was really fulfilling since it was out of the physical/material settings  It adds a layer of newness and adds a layer of experiencing the `beyond-world` from the Spatio-temporal limits  I didn t have any feelings of alienation instead I felt connected to the digital experience right immediately  However  the vagueness of the facial details made me disconnected from the experience a bit  The digital space also could be cozier since the format of the experience is informal discussions  Also  there could be more synchronization between the real moves and the digital moves  Overall  I really enjoyed the experience  I would love to be involved in other VR experiences  Besides  I can state that the distinction between face-to-face and VR experiences can be sharpened through more detailed VR design aspects  Lastly  while writing this essay  in the beginning  I saw my hands as digital 
When I first joined the room  I was aware of the fact that I was not actually in that virtual room  I was sitting alone in a private room by myself  However soon after  like around 5 minutes later  I started to forget about the reality  I was focusing on where the sound is coming from i e  (right or left ear) and reacting to it  I could understand the bodily movements even though sometimes it was weird  I could understand who is looking at me  The only problem was that sometimes there was delays with the sounds and it made it hard to jump into the conversation  Most of the time  the two of us started at the same time  That is partly because the sound is delayed and also because there are no facial expressions in real time  I cant see who is opening their mouth to speak or cant hear who is taking a breath in to get started with speaking  However  it felt real- It was a different reality than the one I am used to  but I never doubted it  After the experience I felt I was closer to those people whom I had just talked to  Face to face or virtual  I think there is no difference except for the fact that in the virtual there are more pixels 
This experience was very nice  It was interesting to talk with my friends in realistic avatars  it s different from the former experiences that I had before (in Horizon Worlds and VRChat)  Also  the conversation subjects were super interesting and it was easy to have a good large conversation about them because the themes are very relevant in our society these days  About the design of the avatar  the only thing that was not so well was the different sizes of the hands  but it doesn t make difference in the quality of the experience  I am already a VR user and for me  the sensations of embodiment and presence are easy to achieve  and this experience was no different: it felt like we were really there in that room  around a table  having that nice conversation  But in VR there s always this ludic characteristic  in which we usually enjoy so much being there that feels like time passes faster than in real life 
I am really impressed by this VR experience  The fact that you lose the real sense of time and space makes you put in another dimension that you might feel everything is the first time  so you are more gentle  In terms of making people together  it is a great tool to increase the intimacy for deeper conversations  I dont know much about capacities of this technology but I would love to walk around with people in  I would love to watch something with them  I want to experience something new with them  in there  I must say physicality of the tool was quite heavy to put it on the head for a long time but laser pointing system accuracy was perfect  Talking sound was also transmitted to right area of ear perceptive  Even though I do believe it is a great tool for layered conversations for people at distance  I am afraid that it is going to be one of those tools that will  capsulate  us and hide us from the real world going outside  I think there are still much to explore  rather than building up up up  we still need more dig  Societal structures need healing and it is not gonna happen with staying still on putting VR  we need to be together  I would love to see VR use for health sector especially for old people and children with disabilities  It might work for sign language courses too- Over all it was an experience I enjoyed  surprised by the accuracy  foresee the beneficial usages but afraid of its ability to take you from the real send of time and space which we need more  everyday 
Having a meeting on a VR room it was a pleasant experience in which time passed fast  It was the first time I ve attended a meeting with friends  and considering that that was a moderated session  or interview  we could have a good time agreeing and disagreeing to each other  Overall the experience was great  Although graphics need improvement  I could definitely feel their presence in the shared space  My headset wasn t working completely as one of the joysticks were missing  or not charged  but that didn t spoiled the experience  Regarding the content of the interview  we began discussing topics related to mental health in social media  and ended talking about the status of the psychology as science  Each of the participants could express their opinion  and share their experiences on different topics such as the abuse of social media  or how to meditate using our phones  and if it s worth it 
I think the experience was pretty good  as always that I get in touch with this kind of technology it s pretty immersive and I get distracted by all the datils of the environment and the avatars  so at the beginning  it was hard to follow the conversation  especially when someone else was talking  But the more I was there I got more familiar with and also less distracted  Sometimes I got I bit frustrated because I wanted to express some concepts that I usually do with my hands when I cannot find the words in my second language  but then I realize that I can adapt those  non-verbal expressions  and use them anyways with the tools provided by the platform  I like the experience I think it could be useful for a lot of aspects like social relationships especially when you are living far from your family and friends  and of course for my profession as a psychologist  I definitely going to use VR and recommend it 
The factor of being able to be immersed in a virtual room  seeing my virtual body  in a virtual room and being able to virtually see my colleagues  made the impact of my first encounter in a social gathering through virtual reality more comfortable  Being able to recognize and perceive people  figures or environments that are familiar to you are effective factors in being able to effectively experience your interaction through the virtual medium  even though symptoms such as anxiety that may be present in virtual immersion in cyberspace may not be as significant  However  I feel it is a factor to be taken into account when facing an unfamiliar dynamic such as social encounters in a virtual environment  having virtual reality spaces  where you can interact with other people or have other types of experiences  is an opportunity that is becoming more and more accessible  making it easy to get out of your comfort zone (traveling  interacting  getting to know other platforms) in a physical place that is to your liking  however  I feel that it is a tool that depending on your personality type and interest can be useful and generate more dependence  taking into account how much you like to experiment and interact with your physical reality  as it can generate comfort without leaving home and create social bonds without the need for physical interaction 
I had a technical issue with a VR headset  I felt pain in my forehead by the end of experiment so I was a bit disturbed  In general the format of conversation was interesting  but felt very unnatural and I didn t really feel embodiment  It might be due to low quality of avatar hands and unrealistic movements  I like the concept of VR conversations somewhere in the future  it could be very beneficial not only for social interactions  but also for psychotherapy  psychological and psychiatric assessment in telemedicine  Nevertheless  for now I would prefer a video-conference  As for me  the current technological capacity of VR doesn t allow to feel more engaged  but instead make the conversation more distractible and unrealistic  In general  all organizational work in the experiment was made professional  explanations were clear  technical part was working fine  topics of discussions were chosen wisely 
There were some technical issues in the sound  The voice kept getting cut off  I could hear my own echo as well  But besides that  the experience felt quite real  The questions asked were quite intense  I feel it could have generated a good back and forth discussion  however  since I wanted to give other participants a chance to speak as well and not take up too much time of the experiment  I refrained from making a lot of comments  One thing about this technology is that I felt more comfortable talking in front of people as I was not directly making eye contact with anyone  I also did not get the feeling of being evaluated by people  As i could only see my hands in VR  i was not very conscious with ho wmy whole body looked like to other people including my facial expressions which made it more comfortable to talk 
For me  it was not the best experience in a virtual environment compared to the previous ones I ve had  We had some issues with the connection and it interrupted the flow of the conversation cause I couldn t hear my partners and the experimenter at the exact moment they were talking  The quality of the experiment itself was high  in my opinion  It was interesting to have this conversation using VR  and I loved the avatars  They looked very real and made me feel I was really there  In general  I m not the hugest fan of VR but I think in many cases it s a technology that is the best for certain tasks  I will definitely want to use VR in the future for fun and for studies   Also  besides the experiment quality  the headset was quite heavy and by the end of the session my scalp hurt (but this is not related to the study itself)  The technical part of the study was good from my non-tech background point of view  This experience was quite similar to real life thanks to the avatars and the thoroughly created environment with all the furniture and everything else  The physical discomfort did not let me completely immerse into the environment but still  I think we could make it work as a group 
I felt a little strange during the experiment  It didn t feel to me like a real life interaction  I think that if the group discussion was made face to face  I would feel more comfortable  Something about being in a virtual word seems unnatural to me  I believe this type of technology could be very useful in a number of different ways  For research  intervention and even for recreation  and across many different fields of study 
My experience in the VR was really good  I felt embodied and felt just like I feel in the class discussion  Honestly  I would love if we could have classes or meetings in VR  It would save us the time to come and go back from the university  Obviously  it was a little  more  as compared to real life  In real life you do not have heavy headset and earphones all the time so you are comfortable sitting longer hours for a discussion but I am not sure if we can do that in the VR for longer durations 
First  I feel presence and body ownership during the experiment  I was impressed that smiling and eye winking was also captured inside the virtual environment it makes me feel I am engaged even more with the conversation  During the conversation  I tried to look and observe the person who speaking and I was able to understand complete the point she is trying to say   The synchronization of virtual reality with audio facilitated good level of understanding for me  it feels like I am in face to face conversation  However  at some point I was looking around the environment while others are speaking feel more the environment  Compared to face to face conversation I think I was able to converse my ideas more clearly in the VR scenario 
I want to say thank you to the experimenters for this wonderful experience in Virtual reality  I enjoyed every bit of it  I had fun and it was a good conversation in there  I felt like I was on a Television Show with the host Esen  I really loved the conversation and to me  I feel it would be the same if it was face-to-face as well  The conversations were real and so was my experience in virtual reality  I think the connecting factor to the experience was the fact that the other participants I was conversing with were my colleagues and we share the same thoughts  we have a good relationship before the experiment which makes it easier in relating and syncing in the VR  I don t know if it would be the same for participants who have never met before in real life  I would love to use this technology and try this again and again 
I enjoyed the conversation  It is much closer to a face to face conversation than e g   a Zoom meeting  However  the light needs to be improved  The faces are pretty dark and overall the low lightbake resolution reduces the fidelity of the environment  Also the jitter of the other avatars is distracting 
Overall an enjoyable  short and interesting experience  The first that I found was that the office environment seems not to be the best place for an in-depth talk in which personal opinions and perhaps beliefs are discussed  Also  it could feel more natural if the experimenter follows a bit the arguments presented by participants  of course without adding or changing anything in their views  The avatars feel nice and allow a part of real world communication to be conveyed to the rest of participants  The questions about the role of  social media  and the image of self within VR worlds seem very important nowadays  One point that I find is of utmost importance is the differences in  the scale and speed of change between real/world and virtual worlds  whether social media and in VR  Finally I would suggest a quiet room in which subjects can complete the final questionnaire by themselves 
The body language and the appearance of the avatars were surprisingly natural  apart from some small features  such as texture issues here and there  teeth appearance and sometimes slightly unrealistic hand positions  I felt rather present during the whole experience  I felt a bit self-conscious and worried that my own avatar did not look right  both from observing texture on my lower body and from previous screenshots  Being conscious of how one looks during a meeting is a natural part of real-life social encounters  Being unable to control it and check it properly before the experience might have prevented me from fully immersing myself in the situation  Providing more agency and control in terms of self-representation and avatar appearance is important for successful virtual collaborative experiences and is a prerequisite for broader use of technology  It was important to be able to maintain eye contact with collaborators and engage in regular body language during the conversation 
 I think overall it was a good experience  and it was quite similar to reality  In fact  once immersed  you kind of  forgot  that you were in virtual reality  On the downside  I don t think it fully replaces face-to-face interaction in terms of a real experience  but for expressing opinions  I think people feel more comfortable doing so  
My experience has been good  I haven t felt bad at any moment or anything  People looked a bit strange and blurry  and when I saw myself in full  it was shocking  but the environment and the room looked good  I could hear the experimenter very softly and a repetitive background word that was a bit annoying  Everything else was fine  The face-to-face experience with colleagues was different because not being able to see facial expressions  I wasn t sure when it was someone else s turn to speak or other things  communication felt very robotic  and sometimes there were silences because we didn t know if someone else wanted to start speaking or what was happening  I would like to use this type of technology for other things like video games because it makes me feel more immersed in that virtual reality  
The experience was quite entertaining  Initially  I had an experience that had never happened to me before because when I put on the headset and headphones  I was completely immersed  I started looking at my hands and seeing how they moved  and I was so assimilated to the avatar that at one point  my real hands collided  but the avatar s hands were separate  so I got scared and didn t understand what was happening until I realized they were the avatar s hands  As for the conversation  I think it was interesting  but it had some things to consider  For example  there were avatars that had worried or angry faces  which in the conversation seemed to be because of the questions  On the other hand  I think the most difficult part of this environment was coordinating participation  Although it s possible to look to one side or the other  at first  it was challenging for us to coordinate  and we interrupted each other  In face-to-face interaction  the intention to speak and taking turns are easier to assign  I think this is a future that is approaching  and it has many advantages  I really liked the experience 
This experience has been satisfying and enriching as I had never interacted with real people in a virtual environment before  It was a comfortable conversation with both the participants and the facilitator  The virtual meeting  in my opinion  was quite different from a real meeting  It s challenging to see the facial expressions of others  you don t know if they re going to start talking or not    Although this didn t hinder the conversation in our meeting  I still prefer having it in a real place  seeing the people I m talking to  The virtual environment and avatars are very close to reality  It was funny to see an avatar with my face and clothes  I think working with this technology could be useful for people who travel for meetings  although  in my opinion  video calls can be closer and more practical 
I found it very curious to see how realistic our avatars were  and I liked how the meeting went  The topics discussed were interesting and allowed each of us to express our views  I liked the way we communicated and the movements we could make 
I find this way of communicating with other people very interesting  seeing how technology is nowadays and how realistic the experiment seemed  It literally felt like we were all in the same room  and it felt like they were right next to you for real  I haven t seen my own avatar  but I noticed the others  and it was very easy to identify each one since they looked very realistic  I could see all the hand movements  which is also an important method of communication  I could see how their mouths moved while they spoke  which made it easier to know who was talking  and the faces and clothes were very well done  I would like to repeat more experiments like this  both because it s virtual reality and I find it very interesting  and because of the topics discussed during the experiment (psychology  social networks  appearances   ) 
For my first contact with Virtual Reality  I liked it a lot  The first thing I did when I put on the goggles was to look all around me to see what was there  And when I was in the main room  at the debate table  I couldn t stop looking at my hands and trying to figure out the mechanism for moving them  That s why I kept moving my arms during the experiment  However  before ending  I want to say that I was a little anxious at one point  Because I was the first one to put on the goggles  I wore them for a long time  At one point  I didn t know what to do  and it bothered me because it was boring to keep looking at the same background  So I would like this kind of technology to be available in many more spaces  like in classrooms  as an innovative method 
It was a very strange but also fun experience  as I had never simulated virtual reality before  but I really liked it  I think it looked very real in terms of hand movements  head movements  and even the voice  as when someone spoke and you looked at them  it sounded different than when you didn t look  I would recommend doing the experiment  although it can be a bit overwhelming to wear the goggles and only see the screen  I think people who suffer from anxiety might not be able to do the experiment  I believe that games through virtual reality would be a good idea to feel more immersed in the game  but I think the eyes can get tired after hours of wearing virtual reality goggles  In conclusion  it was a good experience  and I would do it again 
Personally  this experience has seemed very real and innovative to me  It s incredible how through a virtual world  you can have a completely natural conversation  The quality of the experience has been perfect  my avatar looked very similar to myself  and I believe the same goes for the others  I would love to use this type of technology more  although I do have a fear of it replacing the real world  Despite the conversation being perfect and enjoyable  I still prefer to have it in a real place  seeing the people I m talking to  The experience was very similar to what it would have been if it had been face-to-face  I feel like it was truly me  and I gestured as I would in the real world  Additionally  the topics discussed were very interesting and easy to argue  I particularly liked the last topic  as I think it s important to be aware of these ingrained prejudices that we often use unconsciously  Listening to other people s opinions has helped me add more information to what I already knew about these topics  It s very interesting to compare viewpoints with certain individuals and try to see their world  Finally  I want to highlight the excellent treatment  It has been a truly recommendable experience  Thank you very much 
I had tried virtual reality before  but this is the first time I ve been  virtualized  and talked to other people in a virtual world  Although there are technical limitations  such as the level of detail in the avatars (e g   hair shape  3D contour of the body and face     )  which make the virtual world less immersive  I felt more disconnected from reality when I was stimulated by actions that distracted me from the details I used to focus on  For example  while debating  speaking and thinking about the debate topic  combined with the fact that we had been in the virtual world for a while  made me pay less attention to the sense of touch and not notice the headphones or goggles as much  Moreover  I had a stronger impression that I was actually talking to someone  The movement of the mouth while someone spoke was a positive aspect that helped me immerse myself in the virtual world  
 It is unsettling to think about a virtual reality world  Seeing the reproduced avatar surprised me a lot  as with just a photograph  a replica of myself could be generated within a world that I m used to seeing through a screen  And now  I have experienced the sensation of being inside it  It has been interesting to see the gestures of my peers  the direction of their gazes (faces)  and to hear their real voices  It s not the same experience as being in a face-to-face debate  as in real life  there are many more gestural and proxemic details to perceive  However  I was able to perceive  for example  who wanted to speak  when they were listening to me  and when I should yield the floor  It is possible to have a debate in this manner  but I think the aspect that stands out in this experience is the element of surprise: the novelty  the  thrill   the sensation of being  as yourself  in a created world  On the other hand  the technical quality of the experience  the fact that it was difficult for me to join the session or that  for example  depending on where I looked  the system made me leave the room  distracted me from the conversation  With an improvement in this aspect  I believe the experience would have been much more immersive  Finally  I would like to use this type of technology more frequently  perhaps on a monthly basis  and see how its configuration evolves 
The experience seemed very interesting to me  I had never experienced virtual reality before  and I consider the experience to be enriching  I could clearly feel the conversation and understood the dynamics of the exercise  The questions were interesting  and the conversation unfolded naturally and comfortably  I hope that this exercise helps improve this type of experience and explore how to incorporate virtual reality into psychological research  Seeing my friends with avatars resembling them made me more comfortable with the experience  I hope it was out of curiosity and not egocentrism  but I would have liked to see my own face and body reflected in a mirror  I couldn t see my colleagues  gaze clearly  I didn t know if they were looking me in the eyes while speaking  So sometimes when they spoke  I didn t look them in the eyes either and focused on observing the virtual environment  In real life  if someone speaks to me  I would try not to avert my gaze to show that I am paying attention to what they are saying  The faces from a distance looked more or less real  but the expression and movement didn t  The questions were very good  Very interesting topics  I could hear Benjamin s voice in real life and seconds later through the headphones  Personally  I wouldn t like to use this type of technology  Maybe occasionally as a novel game  but not on a monthly basis  I believe that physical contact is crucial for humans  an element that is missing in the deception of virtual reality  Currently  there is already a great discrimination against those who don t have certain technologies  those who don t know how to use them  and those who don t want to use them  I worry about what would happen if the virtual reality dominates the world instead of the normal reality  What would happen if someone doesn t want to be part of it? The virtual world is an exclusive world  It seems increasingly that to be more real  you must be part of the digital world  How ironic 
Since I was very young  I have been surrounded by computers  but this is the first time I have done a virtual reality experiment  First of all  I am  as I imagine all first-timers are  amazed  Even though it is not the most realistic in terms of graphics and sound  it is much more convincing to my brain than I expected  On the other hand  I cannot help but feel a great rejection towards it  perhaps due to my personality  Despite being aware that all this will never surpass real interaction  the same can be said about social media  and yet here I am being an unconditional user of them  It saddens me  on the other hand  to think that it is us who decide to create devices like these  which break the barriers of reality and allow us to escape from it  But that s what happens and has always happened  Theater  for example  contains part of the concept of virtual reality: entertainment (although possibly with fewer implications for mental health)  I would be delighted to say that I will never resort to virtual reality to satisfy my needs  but I know very well that I would be deceiving myself  It is an incredible technology that can bring very positive things after all  and I believe it would be a mistake not to seek to exploit it to the fullest  even knowing the potential risks  The responsibility lies with each individual to let themselves be deceived or not  unfortunately  
 I really enjoyed participating  it was the first time and I would do it again  It s strange because you know it s you and you know who the people you re talking to are  but it doesn t feel that way  Honestly  I would love to use this technology more often and try it with video games  work meetings  or university classes to see the difference compared to real life  Face-to-face  I believe you can see facial and body expressions better and interpret the person s messages and explanations more accurately  Although that s the only difference I find  everything else seems the same to me  There is communication  and what you want to share reaches the other people I felt like I was inside The Sims game  truly aware that I control my body  that it s me  I have constantly reminded myself that the people I was seeing were real and that the parts of my body I could see were real too  In conclusion  I would do it again many times  Thank you for the opportunity 
When I found out about this experiment  I was very curious  although it s true that I felt a lot of respect for it because I had never used this technology before  I was pleasantly surprised by the experiment  it was an incredible experience  and you can tell that there is a lot of work behind it  It s true that this experiment could have been done face-to-face  but in my opinion  doing it in virtual reality makes it a unique experience  and the participants are more attentive and engaged because it s something new and we are very curious to discover all the details  Additionally  an interesting and current topic was addressed  making the conversation more fluid and engaging  I would recommend this experience to everyone who has the opportunity 
I really liked the experiment  It is true that at the beginning I got a little dizzy  but that s because I m not used to so much immersion  I suppose  It was quite different from a face-to-face conversation  especially in terms of body and facial gestures  Many times I didn t know when to start speaking in case one of my colleagues was about to speak  Nonetheless  I found it very useful  and given the circumstances  quite  normal   The room was well done  and the avatars as well  You can tell that a lot of effort and work have been put into it  The overall experience seemed very futuristic to me  and if the environment had been a cafe or a bar with other connected people having parallel conversations  it would have seemed very real (so real that it would have scared me a little)  I would like to congratulate the researchers for their work  Congrats  it s truly amazing 
 I found it to be a very interesting experience  Technology has reached an incredible point where it can replicate interpersonal relationships like this  Obviously  it wasn t a perfect replica since nothing is perfect  but the experience itself has nothing to envy from a face-to-face conversation  Perhaps  in the future  if this technology continues to develop  physical interaction with others won t even be necessary  Although it s a bit scary to think about losing physical contact and how perceptions of relationships might change  it seems inevitable  Personally  at first  I felt a bit strange and disconnected from the situation  but as it progressed  it felt like a normal conversation among friends 
At the beginning  it was very strange to see everything so uniform  The sensation of looking at your hands or touching something and not feeling it was also very strange  But above all  I would highlight the fact that little by little  you get accustomed to that reality  and it becomes the reality itself  even though you know it s not  Also  having a conversation with people in a virtual reality environment somehow made me externalize the situation because deep down  I knew that it wasn t my reality as such  Undoubtedly  a memorable experience with a technology that I would like to use again at some other time  but with the ability to move around in the virtual space Finally  I believe that having a conversation through virtual reality differs greatly from having it face-to-face because  as I mentioned before  it s much easier for you to detach yourself from the situation 
It has been a very different experience from what I m used to  It was interesting to be able to talk about normal topics through technology  it was as if a door opened to being together when we weren t really physically present  It was very strange to see my friends and myself without being there  It was well done  and the hands moved in accordance with what we were doing  allowing us to gesture  This type of technology seems very interesting  fun  and definitely has the potential to open many doors in the future  I think talking through virtual reality is a cool mix between face-to-face and online conversations  as if you can do both  I didn t feel like I was in the presence of anyone  but I wasn t alone either  It was very interesting  Personally  I enjoyed the experience  It was strange to look through the goggles  but as we kept talking  it didn t feel like it was online  it felt like we were all sitting face to face at a table  The image and sound quality were very good  even though we weren t physically together  It was fascinating when I could turn my face to look at someone  and the sound would come directly from them  not from the side  as if I were really there  During the period of confinement  it would have been very interesting to have this technology to talk to friends without leaving the house  but in day-to-day life  I think it s preferable to do it in person    although it really felt realistic  as if we were together  so there wouldn t be much difference in behavior between the real and digital social environments  as we discussed in the questions  In conclusion  it was a very rewarding and positive experience  and I m glad I participated in the experiment  It was a lot of fun 
 It has been a very interesting experience that opened up discussions about the use of technology in today s world  generational gaps  and how it affects various areas  including politics  I believe that the fact that everything was done via VR provided some ease  In my opinion  it was somewhat easier to express certain opinions or develop arguments simply because it wasn t a physical experience  Perhaps this is where ethics come into play  determining how and when we should use this type of technology  For me  it has been a beautiful experience with a very interesting exchange of ideas and well-organized dynamics with thought-provoking questions  Maybe in a second experience  a more dynamic space would emerge  but overall  I felt comfortable  It s something I would definitely repeat  but despite the ease of communicating certain ideas  I wouldn t trade face-to-face interaction for anything  Non-verbal expression  body language  and other aspects contribute significantly to communication and should not be taken for granted  as they provide us with valuable information about the people in front of us  Thank you very much for the opportunity!
In general  I consider it to be a positive experience  I managed to stay focused and immersed in the interaction with my peers  I didn t feel dizzy  and it was fun to see the avatars and myself virtually  Regarding the difference compared to a face-to-face debate  I think being in an artificial and controlled environment made me pay much more attention to what my peers were saying and doing  rather than being distracted by my surroundings or even by myself  However  I did have some moments of getting distracted by looking at my hands going through the virtual table or observing the gestures and posture of my peers  avatars  I enjoyed experiencing virtual reality  wearing the goggles  feeling like I was in the environment  and seeing an avatar representing myself  In fact  as soon as I accessed the virtual space  I thought of some video games I played as a teenager where the characters had a similar appearance  and I thought it would be cool to experience them like this  But at the same time  I m aware that I wouldn t regularly use virtual reality video games or participate in debates or training sessions in this format because I don t play many video games in general  and I tend to prefer in-person interactions  Additionally  I feel that using this type of virtual environment can be tiring  expensive  and cumbersome  One area where I believe it could have an interesting application is in the field of mental health  especially in clinical psychology  for conducting exposure therapies with patients who have specific phobias that require exposure to environments or elements that are not easily obtained or accessible in the therapeutic space 
 The experience has been positive overall  Regarding the physical adaptation to the virtual environment  at first  it was a moment of exploration  of recognizing the space and my capabilities  what movements I could make  what I could see    Once the environment was discovered  I felt more secure  About the space  it was a bit uncomfortable for me that there wasn t a table that resembled the one in the virtual space  I felt that I didn t adapt well to the space  On the other hand  Marina did have a table and leaned on it  naturalizing the movements  In terms of interaction  I believe it was easy  in part  because we could see each other s bodies  In that sense  the fact that it was our real bodies  that we were identifiable  helped  The conversation was smooth and very natural  both in terms of non-verbal communication [I could see arm gestures  body movements  looking up while thinking of a response  the mouth   ] and sensory aspects [I could hear the person in stereo depending on their position in the virtual room]  as well as personal aspects [we knew each other quite well and  I believe  considered each other interesting]  I would like to use this technology in very limited conditions  for example  to interact with someone who lives far away [whether it s chatting or playing games   ]  However  I hope and wish that this technology doesn t come to replace physical contact  The virtual environment is still very limited  and I doubt it can ever reproduce all the possibilities and information that a relationship in the same physical space offers  Small gestures  the ability to touch  the unpredictability of certain spaces [streets  bars   ] are things that in the virtual space  no matter how extensive they may be  are always limited  It was similar but not the same  It was also a bit uncomfortable  I felt pressure on my forehead  could see a glimmer of light under my nose  and now my eyes feel a bit tired  At the same time  although  as I mentioned  non-verbal communication could be perceived  the avatars are not good enough to capture much of the information  For example  movements that are made in the non-virtual space were difficult to interpret in the virtual world  In any case  it s a positive evaluation  Thank you  Esen  and the entire team involved!
